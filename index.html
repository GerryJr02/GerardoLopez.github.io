            <p>I am a Bachelor's student in Mathematics minoring in Computer Science at the
                University of California, Irvine, with a strong interest in software engineering.
                Currently, I work as a <strong>research assistant</strong> under Dr. Mark Warschauer
                on the Code-AI project,
                <strong>developing software to enhance AI literacy among students</strong>.
                Additionally, I am part of the CP-LEADS fellowship, a program that prepares students
                for Ph.D. programs while offering valuable research experience and tools.
            </p>
            <p>In my role as a research assistant, <strong>I lead the development of back-end
                programs</strong> for a project hosted on AWS, collaborating with Ph.D. candidate
                Daniel Ritchie. Together, our team focuses on creating innovative software to
                provide students with new ways to learn programming and AI, offering me real-world
                experience in collaborative coding.
            </p>
            <p>As a CP-LEADS fellow, I conduct research within a faculty member's lab, leading to
                independent projects. The fellowship provides personalized mentorship and technical
                skills, <strong>aligning with my goal of pursuing a Ph.D. after graduation.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy developing websites, apps, games, and desktop
                applications. Beyond coding, I find pleasure in video games, outdoor running, and
                occasional streaming sessions with friends. These hobbies not only enrich my
                personal life but also contribute to a well-rounded skill set that complements my
                professional endeavors.
